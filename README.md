# Project-VIA

Project-VIA is a community of developers commited to implement free and open source software for social good.

## VIA
The core of the project is focused on VIA, a lightweight mobile application that bridges the communication gap between NGOs and the hard-to-reach population, in particular the internally displaced people. VIA aims to establish a one-stop-shop, safe and reliable canal of vital information for the most vulnerable. 

## Repositories
Project-VIA is under heavy development. The initial work is on a prototype composed of three repositories:
  * [via-mobile](https://github.com/jeanjacquesp/via-mobile): the client of the mobile app (android)
  * [via-cms](https://github.com/jeanjacquesp/via-cms): the webapp for managing the content provided to the app
  * [via-broker](https://github.com/jeanjacquesp/via-broker): the backend of the mobile app

Note that the protoype version uses code/design shortcuts and is prone to errors/failures. 


## Contributing
Contribution is on invite only. You can always fork the projects if you wish to, although note that the current repositories lack some base configs and template data, and any installation/setup requires a lot of effort without the input from the contributors.
