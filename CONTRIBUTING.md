#### How to contribute

If you want to contribute, please create a new pull request:
1.  Fork the developement branch
2.  Create your branch and develop on it
3.  Keep your branch in sync
4.  Commit your changes to your forked repository (make sure your commits have clear and concise messages). You'll need to "sign-off" your git commit.

### Code review guidance

New code will be reviewed thoroughly. 

Do not neglect the importance of:
-   Readability - the code should be easy to read and should be documented.
-   Test - new code should be covered by unit test.
